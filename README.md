# OffgridLoraCom

With OffgridLoraCom you can use your smartphone to communicate with other users in your range, independently from mobile service and internet.

It is a little box containing an esp32 uC and a lora transceiver. The ESP creates a wifi you join with your smartphone. There, you access the local webapp that looks similar to messengers you are used to on your smartphone. The difference is, messages are sent out using the lora transceiver and can be received by other users in your range. The range depends on several environmental circumstances like buildings, vegetation, etc. In rural areas you can probably reach a radius of some kilometres.

This is a spare time project, so progress will be slow.
